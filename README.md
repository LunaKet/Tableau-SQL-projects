## Mental Health Dashboard
This dashboard uses a synthetic dataset from kaggle.  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/mental-health-diagnosis-and-treatment-monitoring  
It plots key metrics that may be of use to hospitals and clinicians, such as demographics of the patients and the distribution diagnoses. It also plots treatment adherence and durations against a few outcome metrics.
